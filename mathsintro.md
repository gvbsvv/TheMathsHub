## Navigating The Maths Hub

We've organized our content by grade level and subject, mirroring typical curriculum structures.  Each subject is broken down into units, making it easy to find what you need.  Simply select the grade level and subject that matches your interest, and then choose the specific unit you'd like to explore.

## What You'll Find

Within each unit, we offer a variety of learning materials designed to cater to different learning styles:

*   **Clear Explanations:** We provide concise and accessible explanations of key mathematical concepts, definitions, and theorems.  We break down complex ideas into manageable parts, making them easier to understand.
*   **Illustrative Examples:**  Learning by doing is essential in mathematics.  We include numerous worked-out examples that demonstrate how to apply the concepts to solve problems step-by-step.
*   **Practice Opportunities:**  Reinforce your understanding with a wide range of practice problems.  Many problems include detailed solutions to help you learn from your mistakes and build your problem-solving skills.
*   **Visual Learning:** Visual aids like diagrams, graphs, and interactive elements are incorporated throughout the site to make learning more engaging and intuitive.

## Subjects Covered

The Maths Hub covers the following math subjects:

**Middle School:**

*   **Math 6:**  Covers foundational concepts including area, surface area, ratios, rates, percentages, fractions, arithmetic in base 10, expressions, equations, rational numbers, data sets, and distributions.
*   **Math 6 Plus:** Builds upon Math 6, introducing scale drawings, proportional relationships, and expanding the study of rational numbers and data analysis.
*   **Math 7:** Explores scale drawings, proportional relationships, circles, percentages, rational number arithmetic, expressions, equations, inequalities, angles, triangles, prisms, probability, and sampling.
*   **Math 7 Plus:** Extends Math 7 with measuring circles, rigid transformations, congruence, dilations, similarity, slope, linear relationships, equations, systems, functions, volumes, exponents, scientific notation, the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers, probability, sampling, and data associations.
*   **Math 8:** Focuses on rigid transformations, congruence, dilations, similarity, slope, linear relationships, equations, systems, functions, volumes, data associations, exponents, scientific notation, the Pythagorean theorem, and irrational numbers.

**High School:**

*   **Math 1 (Algebra I):** Introduces sequences, linear and exponential functions, features of functions, equations, inequalities, connections between algebra and geometry, systems of equations and inequalities, quadratic functions, structures of quadratic functions, and data modeling.
*   **Math 2 (Geometry):** Covers transformations, symmetry, congruence, constructions, proofs, geometric figures, dilation, similarity, quadratic functions, transformations, solving quadratic equations, variations, square root functions, and probability.
*   **Math 3 (Algebra II / Precalculus):**  Explores congruence, structure, proof, circles, geometric modeling, functions, inverses, exponential and logarithmic functions, polynomial functions, rational functions and expressions, modeling periodic behavior, and statistical modeling.
